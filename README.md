<p> Thanks for checking out the supporting GravityShade stuff! Github Desktop just provides a really easy way for me to update the gallery/changelog/whatever, even though HTML is super easy, I only get so much free bandwidth for my website and I want to avoid possible issues as much as possible. Anyway, thanks!</p>
